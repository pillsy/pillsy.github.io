title: "There's a ridiculous amount of primes"
---

[Last time][last] (years ago, since I am extremely bad at this "regular updates") bit, I showed a
proof that there are an infinite number of primes. This proof was depended on the fact that the harmonic 
series diverges, that is $ \sum_{k = 1}^N \frac{1}{k} $ grows without bound as $ N $ goes to $ +\infty $.
